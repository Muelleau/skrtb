## SkRtb

_pronunciation: (es-kay-rtb)_

SkRtb is a collection of data structures useful for real time bidding applications. This
includes the objects found in the OpenRTB spec (like BidRequest, BidResponse, etc..) as well
as useful structures from demand and supply side platforms like Advertisers, Creatives, Campaigns,
etc.

When complete, this library will provide all of the data record classes you need to implement
a real time bidding system.
